# Install the CLI

The GitGone CLI is the primary way to interact with your secrets. It handles encryption locally, ensuring your raw data never leaves your machine.

<Callout type="info">
  **Prerequisites:** You need **Node.js (v20 or newer)** installed on your computer.
</Callout>

## 1. Installation or Quick Run

You can either install the CLI globally for frequent use or run it directly using `npx` without installing anything.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'npx']}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add -g @project-gitgone/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @project-gitgone/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn global add @project-gitgone/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npx">
    If you don't want to install the CLI globally, you can prefix any command with `npx`:
    ```bash
    npx @project-gitgone/cli <command>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 2. Connect to your Server

Before logging in, the CLI needs to know where your GitGone server is located. You can set this globally:

```bash
gitgone config set serverUrl https://your-gitgone-server.com
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Already have a `.gitgone` file?** If your project already contains a `.gitgone` configuration file (e.g. you just cloned a repo already using GitGone), you can skip this step. The CLI will automatically use the `serverUrl` defined in that file for all commands within this directory.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  If you are a server administrator, running `gitgone admin setup` will also configure your `serverUrl` automatically.
</Callout>

## 3. Login

Once the URL is set, authenticate your account:

```bash
gitgone login
```

The CLI will ask for your **Email** and **Password** directly in your terminal. This will securely fetch and store your encrypted private vault.

## 4. Project Initialization

To start using GitGone in a specific project, navigate to your project folder and run:

```bash
gitgone init
```

This interactive command will help you:
- Create a new project on the server OR link an existing one.
- Generate and share the necessary encryption keys.
- Create a local `.gitgone` file to store project-specific settings.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Command not found: gitgone">
  Make sure your global bin directory is in your system's PATH. For `pnpm`, you might need to run `pnpm setup`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connection Refused">
  Verify that your `serverUrl` is correct and that the server is reachable (no VPN or firewall blocking the connection).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Verification">
  To check your current version and configuration:
  ```bash
  gitgone --version
  gitgone config get
  ```
</Accordion>
