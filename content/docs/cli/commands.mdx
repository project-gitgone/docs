# Command Reference

The GitGone CLI is organized into logical groups to help you manage your secrets, teams, and projects efficiently.

## Authentication & Config

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="gitgone login">
  Authenticate your CLI with your GitGone server. You will be prompted for your email and password directly in your terminal.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone config">
  Manage your local configuration (like the server URL).
  - `gitgone config set <key> <value>`
  - `gitgone config get <key>`
  - `gitgone config list`
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Working with Secrets

These are the commands you'll use most frequently during development.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="gitgone init">
  Initialize GitGone in your current project directory. It creates a `.gitgone` configuration file.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone link">
  Link your local directory to an existing project on the GitGone server. This is useful when you've cloned a repository that already uses GitGone.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone push">
  Encrypt and upload your local `.env` file to the server for a specific environment.
  ```bash
  gitgone push
  ```
  Options:
  - `-e, --env <environment>`: Target environment (default: "development").
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone pull">
  Fetch and decrypt the latest secrets from the server into your local `.env` file.
  ```bash
  gitgone pull
  ```
  Options:
  - `-e, --env <environment>`: Target environment (default: "development").
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone run">
  Inject secrets directly into your application's memory without touching the disk. 
  **Recommended for security.**
  ```bash
  gitgone run -- npm start
  ```
  Options:
  - `-e, --env <environment>`: Target environment (default: "development").
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## History & Rollbacks

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="gitgone history">
  List the version history of secrets for the current project and environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone rollback">
  Revert to a previous version of your secrets instantly.
  ```bash
  gitgone rollback
  ```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Project Tokens

Project tokens allow applications (like those in CI/CD pipelines, or programmatic scripts) to fetch secrets without a user account.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="gitgone tokens list">
  List all active tokens for the current project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone tokens create <name>">
  Generate a new project token. 
  
  <Callout type="warn">
    The token secret is only shown once. Make sure to save it securely!
  </Callout>

  Options:
  - `-e, --env <environment>`: The environment this token has access to.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone tokens delete <id>">
  Revoke a project token by its ID.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Team Management

Manage your collaboration units.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="gitgone team create <name>">
  Create a new team (organization) on the server.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone team list">
  List all teams you are a member of.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone team list-members">
  List all members and their roles in a team.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone team add-member">
  Invite a new member to your team by their email address.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Project Management

Manage applications within your teams.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="gitgone project create <name>">
  Create a new project within one of your teams.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gitgone project set-policy">
  Configure security rules for the current project:
  - **Standard**: Allows `gitgone pull` to disk.
  - **Memory-only**: Disables `pull`, forcing the use of `gitgone run` for maximum security.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Key Management

GitGone uses end-to-end encryption. These commands help manage the keys that protect your data.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="gitgone keys share">
  When a new member joins a team, they don't have the project keys yet. An existing member with access must run this command to securely share the project key with them.
  
  <Callout type="info">
    This process is fully encrypted. Your CLI will fetch the new member's public key and encrypt the project key specifically for them.
  </Callout>
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Administration

Commands reserved for server administrators (SuperAdmins).

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="gitgone admin setup">
  The very first command to run after setting up a new server. It creates the SuperAdmin account and generates the master keys.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="gitgone admin users">
  Manage users globally on the server.
  - `gitgone admin users list`: List all registered users.
  - `gitgone admin users create`: Create a new user account with a specific system role.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="gitgone admin teams">
  Manage teams globally on the server.
