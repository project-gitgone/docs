description: Overview of GitGone client libraries.

GitGone provides client libraries to easily integrate secrets management into your applications. These libraries handle the fetching, decryption, and injection of your project secrets from a GitGone server.

Currently, we offer a dedicated library for Node.js, with more to come in the future.

### Available Libraries

- **[@project-gitgone/node](/docs/libraries/node)**: For Node.js applications.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Decryption**: All secrets are fetched encrypted and decrypted locally using your project token.
- **Process Environment Injection**: Automatically populates `process.env` with your secrets.
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use API to access secrets programmatically.
- **Secure by Design**: Your master key never leaves your server; secrets are only decrypted at runtime in your application.

### Usage with CLI & Server

The client libraries work in tandem with the **[GitGone CLI](/docs/cli)** for local development and the **[GitGone Server](/docs/server)** for secret storage and distribution.

1. **Store** your secrets on the GitGone Server.
2. **Access** them in your code via the Libraries using a project token.
3. **Manage** everything using the CLI.
