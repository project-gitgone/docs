While there are many ways to manage environment variables, GitGone is specifically designed for teams who prioritize **security**, **privacy**, and **developer experience**.

## GitGone vs. Dotenv Vault

| Feature | GitGone | Dotenv Vault |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **End-to-End Encryption** | ✅ Yes (Server never sees plain text) | ❌ No (Server manages keys) |
| **Self-Hosting** | ✅ Yes (Docker / Source) | ❌ No (SaaS only) |

## Why GitGone?

### Privacy by Default
In many other solutions, the service provider manages the encryption keys for you. If their database is compromised, your secrets are at risk. With GitGone, **encryption happens on your machine**. The server only ever sees "blobs" of encrypted data that it cannot decrypt.

### Total Control
GitGone is fully open-source and self-hostable. You own your data, your logs, and your infrastructure. No more worrying about third-party uptime or security audits of external SaaS providers.

### Built for Modern Devs
GitGone respects your workflow. It doesn't force you to use a custom dashboard for every minor change. Keep using your favorite editor for `.env` files, and let the CLI handle the secure sync.
