# Architecture & Security

GitGone is built on a "trust-no-one" architecture. This means the server is treated as an untrusted storage medium. It stores your data, but it cannot read it.

## The Security Model

The core of GitGone's security is **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** using standard cryptographic primitives (AES-GCM for content, RSA/ECC for key exchange).

### 1. Local Encryption
When you save a secret using the CLI, the following happens on your local machine:
- The secret values are serialized.
- A **Project Key** (generated when you init a project) is used to encrypt this payload.
- Only the *encrypted ciphertext* is sent to the server.

### 2. The Project Key
The Project Key is the "master key" for a specific project.
- It is generated locally by the project creator.
- It is stored in your local keychain/keyring.
- It is **never** sent to the server in plain text.

### 3. Sharing Access
To add a team member:
1. The new member generates a public/private key pair.
2. They send their public key to the server.
3. An existing admin fetches the public key.
4. The admin's CLI encrypts the **Project Key** using the new member's public key.
5. This encrypted key is uploaded to the server.
6. The new member downloads it and decrypts the Project Key with their private key.
