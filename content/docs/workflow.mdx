# Development Workflow

Managing secrets in a team can be chaotic. GitGone streamlines this by treating secrets with the same rigor as source code, but without the security risk of committing them to Git.

## The Loop

The standard development loop with GitGone mirrors your git workflow:

### 1. Pull (Sync)
Before starting work, ensure you have the latest config.
```bash
gitgone pull
```
This fetches the latest encrypted snapshot from the server and injects it into your local environment or creates a local `.env` file (if configured).

### 2. Modify
Need to add a new API key? Just add it to your local `.env` file as you normally would.
```
STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_12345
```
GitGone doesn't force you to use CLI commands for every single variable change; it respects your existing development habits.

### 3. Push (Share)
When your feature works and you're ready to share the config with the team:
```bash
gitgone push
```
This creates a new immutable version of the secrets and uploads it. Your teammates can now `pull` it.

## Environments

GitGone supports multiple environments (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`) within a single project.
