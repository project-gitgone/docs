# Core Concepts

To make the most of GitGone, it helps to understand how your data is organized. Here is the hierarchy:

<Files>
  <Folder name="Team (Organization)" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="Team Members">
      <File name="Admin (SuperAdmin)" />
      <File name="Member" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="Project (Your App)" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="development">
        <File name="Snapshot v1" />
        <File name="Snapshot v2" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="production">
        <File name="Snapshot v1" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

<Tabs items={['👥 Teams', '📁 Projects', '🔐 Secrets', '🏗️ Environments']}>
  <Tab value="👥 Teams">
    A **Team** (or Workspace) is your main organizational unit. Usually, a team represents your entire company or a specific group of developers.

    - You can be a member of multiple teams.
    - Each team has its own members and its own projects.
    - **Admins** can manage team membership and system-wide settings.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="📁 Projects">
    Inside your team, you'll create **Projects**. A project usually corresponds to a single application, a microservice, or a specific infrastructure component.
    
    - Secrets are scoped to a project.
    - Access is managed at the project level.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="🔐 Secrets">
    A **Secret** is a versioned collection of environment variables (like in a `.env` file). 
    
    <Callout type="info">
      GitGone doesn't just store "keys"; it stores **Snapshots**. Every time you push, a new version is created, allowing you to track history and roll back if needed.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="🏗️ Environments">
    Projects have different **Environments** (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`). 
    
    - You can have different secret values for each environment.
    - GitGone ensures your app only pulls the values for the environment you specify.
