# Self-Host GitGone

Ready to take control of your secrets? Setting up your own GitGone server is the best way to ensure your data stays private and secure. We've made it as simple as possible using Docker.

<Callout type="info">
  **Why Docker?** It packages everything GitGone needs (database, server, etc.) into a single, easy-to-run container. No manual database setup required!
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- **Docker** installed on your machine.
- A **Domain Name** (if you want to access it from the web).
- 5 minutes of your time!

## Quick Start (The "One-File" Setup)

Everything you need to run GitGone is contained in a single configuration file called `docker-compose.yml`.

<Steps>
### Create a new folder
Keep things organized by creating a dedicated folder for GitGone:
```bash
mkdir gitgone && cd gitgone
```

### Create the configuration file
Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and paste the following content:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: gitgone
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_strong_password
      POSTGRES_DB: gitgone
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U gitgone -d gitgone"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  app:
    image: ghcr.io/project-gitgone/server:latest
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "3333:3333"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3333
      - HOST=0.0.0.0
      - APP_KEY=ChangeMeWithA32CharRandomString!
      - APP_URL=http://localhost:3333
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_USER=gitgone
      - DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_password
      - DB_DATABASE=gitgone

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Don't forget to change `your_strong_password` and `APP_KEY` to something secure!
</Callout>

### Launch your server
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Access your Server
Your server is now running in the background. You can check if it's alive by visiting:
[http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

You should see a JSON response confirming the server is active.

### Initial Admin Setup
Since GitGone is a CLI-first tool, there is no web dashboard. You need to use the CLI to initialize your administrator account and link it to your server.

On your local machine (where you installed the CLI), run:
```bash
gitgone admin setup
```

Follow the prompts to:
1. **Connect to your server**: Enter your server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3333`).
2. **Create your administrator account**: Enter your Email, Password, and Full Name.
3. **Generate your master encryption keys**: The CLI will automatically generate your asymmetric keys and encrypt your vault with your password.

Once done, you'll be automatically logged in as a **SuperAdmin** and ready to manage users and teams!
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="How do I update my server?">
  Updating is easy! Just run:
  ```bash
  docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
  ```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Where is my data stored?">
  Your data is stored in a Docker Volume named `pgdata`. It persists even if you stop or delete the containers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I use a custom domain?">
  Change the `APP_URL` environment variable to your domain (e.g., `https://secrets.example.com`) and set up a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik.
