# Welcome to GitGone Server 👋

You've decided to take control of your configuration secrets—like API keys and database passwords—and that's a fantastic move! 

The GitGone server is the heart of your very own secret management system. It’s a dedicated API server designed to be the single source of truth for your team's encrypted configurations.

## What is GitGone Server?

Think of it as a **secure digital vault** for your team. The server acts as a trusted guardian:
- **Encrypted Storage**: It holds onto your data but never sees it in plain text.
- **Access Control**: It manages who can see or edit secrets for specific projects.
- **Version History**: It keeps track of every change, allowing you to roll back instantly if something goes wrong.

### Why self-host?

- **Total Privacy**: Your secrets never leave your infrastructure.
- **No Third-Party Risk**: You aren't dependent on a SaaS provider's security or pricing.
- **Control**: You own the database, the logs, and the access rules.

## Architecture

GitGone relies on a **Zero-Trust** architecture where the server never has access to the decryption keys. All encryption happens client-side (in the CLI).

For a deep dive into the cryptography and security model, check out the [Architecture & Security](/docs/architecture) page.
